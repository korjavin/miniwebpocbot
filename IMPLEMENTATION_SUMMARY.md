# Implementation Summary

This document provides a summary of the implementation of the Prediction Game project.

## Architecture

The project follows a modern, containerized architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Backend (Pocketbase)**
   - Serves as the database and API server
   - Handles data validation and business logic
   - Manages user accounts, questions, and bets
   - Processes payouts when questions are closed
   - Handles Telegram API interactions securely

2. **Frontend (Next.js)**
   - Provides the user interface for the Telegram WebApp
   - Communicates with the backend via REST API
   - Handles user authentication via Telegram
   - Provides an admin interface for managing questions

3. **Containerization**
   - Both components run in separate containers
   - Docker/Podman Compose for orchestration
   - Separate development and production configurations
   - Volume mounting for persistent data

4. **CI/CD**
   - GitHub Actions for continuous integration
   - Automated container image building and publishing
   - Streamlined deployment process

## Security Considerations

The implementation includes several security measures:

1. **Sensitive Credentials**
   - Telegram bot token is only stored and used in the backend
   - No sensitive information is exposed to the frontend

2. **Authentication**
   - Telegram WebApp authentication is verified on the backend
   - User identity is securely established

3. **Data Validation**
   - Input validation on both frontend and backend
   - Prevention of double voting
   - Balance checks to prevent invalid bets

## Features Implemented

1. **User Management**
   - Automatic user creation based on Telegram identity
   - Balance tracking and updates
   - Persistent user accounts

2. **Question Management**
   - Creation and management of prediction questions
   - Support for multiple options
   - Question status tracking (open/closed)

3. **Betting System**
   - Placing bets on open questions
   - Prevention of double voting
   - Balance deduction on bet placement

4. **Payout System**
   - Automatic calculation of payouts when questions are closed
   - Proportional distribution of points to winners
   - Balance updates for winners

5. **Telegram Integration**
   - Bot setup and configuration
   - Posting questions to channels
   - Announcing results
   - WebApp integration

6. **Admin Interface**
   - Question creation and management
   - Setting correct answers
   - Posting to Telegram channels

## Testing

The implementation includes several testing mechanisms:

1. **Backend Testing**
   - Script for testing Pocketbase API
   - Verification of data models and collections

2. **Frontend Testing**
   - Admin interface for testing functionality
   - Manual testing of the WebApp

3. **Integration Testing**
   - End-to-end testing of the betting flow
   - Telegram bot and WebApp integration testing
